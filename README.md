```

3. Set the environment variable for the OpenAI API key. Replace `<your-api-key>` with your actual OpenAI API key:

Note: Make sure you have obtained an API key from OpenAI.

4. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or a later version installed on your system.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can access the AutoGPT web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided URL or localhost address.

Follow the instructions on the web interface to interact with the AutoGPT model. Enter your text prompts, and the model will generate responses based on the input.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to access the OpenAI API.
- Keep your OpenAI API key secure and avoid sharing it with others.
